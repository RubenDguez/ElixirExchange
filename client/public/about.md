# About Our Project

### Welcome to the Elixir Exchange Platform, a full-stack web application created as part of our bootcamp project. This platform was developed using modern technologies, including React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, CSS, and Sequelize, ensuring a robust and scalable user experience.

## **Key Features**

- User Authentication: Secure login and account creation functionalities allow users to safely access and manage their profiles.

- Drink Creation and Sharing: Users can create and customize their own cocktail recipes, specifying ingredients and spirits, and share them with the community.

- Community Engagement: The platform encourages users to explore and engage with various drink recipes shared by you and others.

## Our Stack:

- Frontend: React handles dynamic user interfaces and ensures a smooth, responsive user experience.

- Backend: TypeScript powers the server-side logic with strong typing, ensuring clean and maintainable code. The backend communicates with the database using Sequelize to manage complex data models efficiently.

- Database: PostgreSQL stores user data and drink recipes, offering stability and high performance.

- Security: Weâ€™ve implemented best practices for secure login and account management, ensuring user data is protected.

### This project demonstrates our ability to work with modern web development tools, collaborate effectively as a team, and deliver a fully functional and user-friendly application.
